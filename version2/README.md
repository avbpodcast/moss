Two versions of the card shuffling algorithm:

## Version 1
- Original implementation
- Single-file structure
- Located in `/version1/`

## Version 2 (Improved)
- Enhanced shuffle algorithm
- Modular JavaScript architecture
- Better statistical metrics
- Located in `/version2/`

## How to Compare
1. Open `version1/index.html` in browser
2. Open `version2/index.html` in another tab
3. Compare shuffle results and metrics

## Technical Improvements in Version 2
- Fixed sequential card bias
- Better packet size distribution
- Selective reversing (33% chance)
- More varied cut sizes
- Additional randomness metrics
